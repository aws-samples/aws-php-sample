 If you instantiate a new client for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with
 no parameters or configuration, the AWS SDK for PHP will look for access keys
 in the following order: environment variables, ~/.aws/credentials file, then finally
 IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 Instances. The first set of credentials the SDK is able
 to find will be used to instantiate the client.

 For more information about this interface to Amazon S3, see:
 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/guide/getting-started/basic-usage.html#creating-a-client

 a new object with the key "hello_world.txt" and content "Hello World!".

 For more examples of downloading objects, see the developer guide:
 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/guide/latest/service-s3.html#downloading-objects

 You can perform the same upload and download operations using Amazon S3 Stream Wrappers,

 like file_get_contents, fopen, copy, etc.

 For more information about stream wrappers, see the Amazon S3 Stream Wrapper
 section in the developer guide:

 Now, we want to delete the bucket. Buckets cannot be deleted unless they're empty. 
 With the AWS SDK for PHP, you have a few options when deleting multiple objects:

  - Use deleteMatchingObjects method:
      http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Aws.S3.S3Client.html#_deleteMatchingObjects 
  - Use the BatchDelete helper:
      http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Aws.S3.BatchDelete.html
  - Or individually delete the objects.

 We'll use the BatchDelete helper to delete the two objects we created.

 Although this sample didn't check for errors when calling service operations,
 real-world applications should always check for errors.
 See the Error Handling section in the developer guide for more information:
